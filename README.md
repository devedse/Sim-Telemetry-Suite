# Sim Telemetry Suite
The Sim Telemetry Suite is a solution that can receive data from your simracing server and show it in a dashboard.

## Features
* Generate track map based on live driver positions
* Show live driver timing details
* Pan and zoom the track view
* Notifications upon lap completion

## Components
An overview of all the components that make up the Sim Telemetry Suite.

### Bridge
The bridge is a little piece of software that catches all the telemetry data from the simulation and pushes it in a json string through a UDP socket. The first implementation is done for rFactor 2, but the Bridge solution can be expanded for other simulations. Building the solution results in a DLL which can be installed under the plugin directory:

### rFactor 2 Dedicated Server
The server software runs the Bridge plugin, which broadcasts UDP messages to a specific port on the same network:

### Receiver
The receiver catches the UDP messages sent by the server, then sends them through SignalR to the dashboard:

### Dashboard
The dashboard receives the data to be displayed and does its own magic:
